# BillCounter

This program was created for St. Gabriel Catholic Parish in Indianapolis, IN. The purpose was to help with the process of counting food orders from the church's annual festival. Throughout the two-day festival, there were over 200 food orders taken. This program helped cut the time it took to count the orders in half.
