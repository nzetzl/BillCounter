This program was created for St. Gabriel Catholic Parish in Indianapolis, IN. The purpose was to help with the process of counting food orders from the church's annual festival. Throughout the two-day festival, there were over 1400 food orders taken. This program saved an estimated 9 hours of time to analyze orders and profits.
